## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Two-player gameplay in the terminal
- Input validation (range checks, taken space prevention)

- Future updates planned: win condition logic, game loop, and replay option

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Function structure and parameter passing
- Loops and conditional logic
- User input validation
- Working with lists and indexing
- Planning code in modular, testable chunks
